# AnyRPG Introduction

AnyRPG is an [open source](https://github.com/AnyRPG/AnyRPGCore) Role Playing Game engine written in [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) for [Unity](https://unity.com/) that enables content creators to rapidly create unique and engaging short stories, scenarios, adventures, and even full games.

By providing a platform with the most common Role Playing Game functionality out of the box, AnyRPG allows content creators to focus directly on the things that make their game unique such as visual assets and story content.
