## Next Steps

* Add food to a [Vendor Collection](../vendor-collection.md) so it can be purchased from a [Vendor](../interactable-option-configurations/vendor-config.md).
* Add food to a [Loot Table](../loot-table.md) so that it can drop upon defeat of an enemy.
* Add food as an output to a [Recipe](recipe.md) so that it can be crafted.
