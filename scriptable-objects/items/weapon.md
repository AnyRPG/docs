## Next Steps

* Configure a [Unit Profile](../unit-profile.md)'s _Equipment Name List_ to provide this weapon to newly created characters.
* Configure a [Character Class](../character-class.md)' _Equipment Names_ list to provide this weapon to newly created characters of that class.
* Configure a [Character Race](../character-race.md)'s _Equipment Names_ list to provide this weapon to newly created characters of that race.
* Configure a [Class Specialization](../class-specialization.md)'s _Equipment Names_ list to provide this weapon to a newly created characters of that specialization.
* Add a weapon to a [Loot Table](../loot-table.md) so that it can drop when an enemy is defeated.
* Add a weapon to a [Vendor Collection](../vendor-collection.md) and make it available on a vendor.
* Add a weapon to an [Equipment Set](../equipment-set.md) to give it unique set bonuses when one or more pieces of a set are equipped.
* Add a weapon as an output to a [Recipe](recipe.md) so that it can be crafted.
