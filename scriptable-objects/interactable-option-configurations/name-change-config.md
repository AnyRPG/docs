# Name Change Config

## Creation

To create a name change config, find (or create) the _GameName/Resources/GameName/InteractableOptionConfig_ folder in the project tab and right click.  Choose _Create > AnyRPG > Interactable > NameChangeConfig_.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (3).png>)

## Properties

A name change config does not have any properties other than the properties shared by all [Interactable Option Configs](./#properties).

## Next Steps

* Add a name change config to a [Unit Profile](../unit-profile.md) to allow the character to serve as a name changer.
