# Bank Config

## Creation

To create a bank config, find (or create) the _GameName/Resources/GameName/InteractableOptionConfig_ folder in the project tab and right click.  Choose _Create > AnyRPG > Interactable > BankConfig_.

## Properties

A bank config does not have any properties other than the properties shared by all [Interactable Option Configs](./#properties).

## Next Steps

* Add a bank config to a [Unit Profile](../unit-profile.md) to allow the character to serve as a bank.
