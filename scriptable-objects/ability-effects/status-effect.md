## Next steps

* Add a status effect to an [Ability](../abilities/).
* Add a status effect to another [Ability Effect](./) to chain them together.
* Add an [Attack Effect](attack-effect.md) to the _Tick Ability Effect Names_ field to make an effect into a DOT (Damage Over Time) effect.
* Add a [Heal Effect](heal-effect.md) to the _Tick Ability Effect Names_ field to make an effect into a HOT (Heal Over Time) effect.
