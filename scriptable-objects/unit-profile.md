| Persist Object Position      | If true, the object position is saved so that the object will spawn at the saved location next time a game is loaded. This requires at least one of _Save On Level Unload_, _Save On Game Save_, or a save setting in a [Patrol](patrol-profile.md) to be true.   |
| Save On Level Unload         | If true, the position will be saved when a level is unloaded.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Save On Game Save            | If true, the position will be saved when the game is saved.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Overwrite Unit UUID          | If true, the automatic UUID assigned to the unit will be overwritten with the UUID in the _UUID_ field.                                                                                                                                                           |
| UUID                         | A automatically created Universally Unique Identifier used to ensure that all objects with saved position data do not overwrite another object's data.                                                                                                            |

## Next Steps

* Add a unit profile to the _Default Player Unit Profile Name_ field in the System Configuration Manager to make this unit the default when a new game is started.
* Add a unit profile to the _Character Creator Profile Names_ list in the System Configuration Manager to allow a player to choose this unit from a list of units when starting a new game.
* Add a unit profile to the _Character Creator Profile Names_ list in a [Faction](faction.md) to allow a player to choose this unit from a list of units when starting a new game as a specific [Faction](faction.md).
