## Properties

Currency has no additional properties beyond the properties [shared](introduction.md#properties) by all scriptable objects.

## Next Steps

* Assign a currency to an [Item](items/) so that it has a vendor buy and sell price.
* Use a currency as a [Quest](quest.md) reward.
* Use a [Currency Item](items/currency-item.md) as loot to provide this currency when defeating an enemy.
* Add a currency to a [Currency Group](currency-group.md) to allow automatic conversion between larger and smaller units.
