# Included sample games

## Welcome Window

You can find links to the included sample games in the welcome window.  The window will pop up automatically when you open the Unity project, but if you have just installed the package and not closed the Unity editor yet, you can still open it manually by clicking on the _Tools_ menu in the menu bar and choosing _AnyRPG > Welcome Window_.

A brief description of the purpose of each game is listed below.

### A Lost Soul Story Demo Game

A Lost Soul Story Demo is the first 2 chapters of the game A Lost Soul re-created using the open source assets include in the AnyRPG Engine.

### A Lost Soul Character Demo Game

A Lost Soul Character Demo allows you to explore the world of A Lost Soul by playing as any character and faction you encounter during the more linear story game.

### Content Demo Game

The Content Demo allows you to view all included textures, 3D models, and audio content in the AnyRPG Unity package.  You can play as any of the included character models.  It contains a single playable scene with all 3D models organized by type, all textures, and audio players that allow playing any ambient sound, background music, or sound effects.

{% endhint %}

### Features Demo Game

The Features Demo Game is intended to be a simple demonstration of all features supported by AnyRPG.  Since the majority of the content in the features demo game was installed using the Template Content Wizard, it also somewhat serves as an example of what type of template content can be quickly installed in your own games using the wizard.

### Empty (Zero Config Mode) Game

All of the above games use AnyRPG in configured game mode, meaning they contain a separate loading scene, main menu, and content scenes.  They also contain their own resources folders and Game Manager configurations.

The Empty Game is a demonstration of how AnyRPG can be used as a character controller to allow you to explore a scene using the default player model by simply adding and unconfigured GameManager prefab to the scene.
