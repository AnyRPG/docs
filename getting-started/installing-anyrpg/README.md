# Installing AnyRPG

There are 3 ways to obtain AnyRPG.

* AnyRPG Core can be found on the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/234361).  This package is not bundled with UMA and must be manually configured after installation.
* AnyRPG Core can be found on [Github](https://github.com/AnyRPG/AnyRPGCore). This project is identical to the Unity Asset Store package.  It is not bundled with UMA and must be manually configured after installation.
* AnyRPG Engine can be downloaded in Unity Package format directly from [anyrpg.org/downloads](https://www.anyrpg.org/downloads/).  This package contains the exact same functionality as AnyRPG Core, but is pre-configured with all dependencies already installed, and has approximately twice as many icons, audio files, and 3d models.
