| Load Resources Folders | <p>Because AnyRPG supports multiple games in the same project, it is necessary to only load the Scriptable Objects that apply to the correct game.  Each game has its own resources in subfolder of a Resources folder in the format <em>Resources/YourGameName</em>.<br>This has the added benefit of allowing the developer to have shared resources that can be re-used across multiple games.<br>This list contains the names of all Resources subfolders that should be loaded into memory when the game is launched.</p> |
