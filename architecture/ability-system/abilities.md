# Abilities



Abilities have 3 basic ways to determine when it is time to cast an effect:

1. Event based abilities are triggered by events in animations, and can be triggered multiple times by the same animation if that animation has multiple events configured.
2. Instant abilities cast their effect right away, and in the cast of channeled abilities, instantly on each tick of the channel.
3. Complete abilities cannot cast their effect until a cast reaches the end of its cast timer and completes successfully.
