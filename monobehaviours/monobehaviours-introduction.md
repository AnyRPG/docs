# Monobehaviours Introduction

[Unity Monobehaviours](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html) are scripts that can be added to Prefabs and GameObjects to control their behavior.&#x20;

AnyRPG makes use of nearly 300 Monobehaviours as part of the engine; however, most of those are part of system objects and the UI, and do not need to be edited or have their serialized properties updated under normal circumstances.

This section describes the usage of Monobehaviours that are meant to be edited by game creators.

The most important monobehaviour scripts included in AnyRPG are added through the included [Wizards](../wizards/wizards-introduction.md) and template prefabs, but any that are meant to be edited can easily be manually added to GameObjects by following their documentaton.
