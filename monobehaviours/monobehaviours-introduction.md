# Monobehaviours Introduction

[Unity Monobehaviours](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html) are scripts that can be added to Prefabs and GameObjects to control their behavior.

The most important monobehaviour scripts included in AnyRPG are added through the included [Wizards](../wizards/wizards-introduction.md) and template prefabs.

Not all monobehaviours have a [Wizard](../wizards/wizards-introduction.md)duct available yet, so this section describes the usage of the ones that must be manually added to Prefabs.
